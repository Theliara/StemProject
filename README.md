Thank you very much for coming and interacting with our group. In this depository all files shown at the Stem Night are stored. Feel free to mess with anything you wish.

In order to access the game shown during Stem Night unzip the folder called "Horsepower Game.zip". Inside will be an executable called "Terminator.exe". This is a reference to our original idea to make a Terminator themed presentation even though I myself haven't seen any of the movies.


Controls for the game:

Q - Soft Reset (Keep all inputted variables but reset position)

R - Hard Reset (Reset position as well as inputted variables)

Space - Start simulation

I - Toggle informational hud


Since you have made it this far in the README file I will share an easter egg placed in the game. If you use WASD you can actually control the Jay's movements without inputting anything. Run to the finish line while having nothing inputting for weight, time, and distance. After that run to the bottom left of the background art. ;)
